# Dotfile

Unified. Organized. Personalized.

## Quickstart

If you donâ€™t already have a huge collection of dotfiles simply run the installer and follow the prompts:

```Shell
git clone git://github.com/thcipriani/dotfile-boilerplate ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap --new-setup
```

Follow the prompts

If you already have a collection of dotfiles then you should omit the `--new-setup` flag
so that you won't be prompted to install any frameworks
